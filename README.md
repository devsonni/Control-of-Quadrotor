# Control of Quadrotor 🎮            
✈️ This repository consist of code for PID controllers for controlling quadrotors in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D planes to move on predefined trajectories.            
##         
### 🕹️ 1-D control 🕹️        
    🎯 Target location is 1m in Z direction.

### 🕹️ 2-D control 🕹️    


### 🌌 Trajectory generation to pass quadrotor from the way-points 🌌               

### 🛬 Analyse how thrust to weight ration and initial speed affects on quadrotor 🛬                    


○ Analyse how thrust to weight ratio and initial speed affect on Quadrotor.     
○ Built Controller for controlling Quadrotor in 1-D and 2-D plane for moving in predefined trajectories.    
○ Built trajectory for Quadrotor to pass from the way-points in 3-D plane.
